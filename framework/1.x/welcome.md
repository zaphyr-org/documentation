ZAPHYR is a modern, lightweight, and fast PHP framework that is designed to help you build web applications quickly
and efficiently. The framework is heavily inspired by the [Laravel](https://laravel.com) and
[Symfony](https://symfony.com) frameworks and aims to provide a simple and easy-to-use API for developers. The goal of
the ZAPHYR framework is not to reinvent the wheel. It started as a whim to learn the PHP programming language and
gradually developed into a solid library.
