# Request Lifecycle

At its core, your application transforms an incoming HTTP request into an appropriate HTTP response. This process is
orchestrated by passing the request through a pipeline of middleware, controllers, and event dispatchers. Each layer of
this lifecycle plays a specific role, middleware handles cross-cutting concerns like sessions or CSRF protection,
controllers contain the business logic, and events are triggered at critical stages to allow for extensibility and
custom behavior.

But letâ€™s go beyond the basics and take a closer look at the full request lifecycle to understand how each component
works together in detail.

## Overview

The request lifecycle in a ZAPHYR application follows these high-level steps:

1. The request enters the application through the `public/index.php` file
2. The `Zaphyr\Framework\Application` class handles the request
3. The `Zaphyr\Framework\Kernel\HttpKernel` processes the request
4. The `Zaphyr\Router\Router` routes the request to the appropriate controller
5. The response is emitted back to the client

## Request lifecycle diagram

The following diagram illustrates the request lifecycle in a ZAPHYR application:

## Detailed request lifecycle

### 1. Entry point

All requests to a ZAPHYR application enter through the `public/index.php` file. This file:

- Creates an instance of the `Zaphyr\Framework\Application` class
- Binds important interfaces to the container:
    - `Zaphyr\Framework\Contracts\Kernel\HttpKernelInterface` - the main interface for handling HTTP requests
    - `Zaphyr\Framework\Contracts\Kernel\ConsoleKernelInterface` - the interface for handling console commands
    - `Zaphyr\Framework\Contracts\Exceptions\Handlers\ExceptionHandlerInterface` - the interface for handling exceptions
    - `Zaphyr\HttpEmitter\Contracts\EmitterInterface` - the interface for emitting responsess
- Calls the `Application::handleRequest` method with the server request

### 2. Application handling

The `Zaphyr\Framework\Application` class is the main entry point for the ZAPHYR framework. When `handleRequest` is
called:

- It gets the `Zaphyr\Framework\Contracts\Kernel\HttpKernelInterface` from the container
- It calls the kernel's `handle` method with the request
- It uses an `Zaphyr\HttpEmitter\Contracts\EmitterInterface` to emit the response back to the client

### 3. HttpKernel processing

The `Zaphyr\Framework\Kernel\HttpKernel` class is responsible for processing the request:

- It bootstraps the application if it hasn't been bootstrapped yet
- It dispatches a `Zaphyr\Framework\Events\Http\RequestStartingEvent`
- It tries to handle the request using the `Zaphyr\Router\Router`
- If an exception occurs, it handles it with the `App\Exceptions\ExceptionHandler`and dispatches a
  `Zaphyr\Framework\Events\Http\RequestFailedEvent`
- It dispatches a `Zaphyr\Framework\Events\Http\RequestFinishedEvent` and returns the response

### 4. Bootstrapping

The bootstrapping process sets up the application by registering several boot providers:

#### 4.1 EnvironmentBootProvider

- Loads environment variables from the `.env`.
- If the [configuration files are cached](/docs/framework/latest/configuration#cache-configuration), the `.env` file is
  not loaded

#### 4.2 ConfigBootProvider

- Loads configuration files
- Sets the application environment, timezone, and encoding
- Binds the `Zaphyr\Config\Contracts\ConfigInterface` to the container

#### 4.3 ExceptionBootProvider

- Registers the `App\Exceptions\ExceptionHandler`
- Turns off `display_errors` if not in testing environment

#### 4.4 RouterBootProvider

- Creates a new `Zaphyr\Router\Router` instance
- Sets the container on the router
- Sets controller routes, middleware, and route patterns
- Binds the `Zaphyr\Router\Contracts\RouterInterface` to the container

#### 4.5 RegisterServicesBootProvider

- Registers service providers:
    - `Zaphyr\Framework\Providers\LoggingServiceProvider`
    - `Zaphyr\Framework\Providers\EncryptionServiceProvider`
    - `Zaphyr\Framework\Providers\SessionServiceProvider`
    - `Zaphyr\Framework\Providers\EventsServiceProvider`
    - And any other providers specified in the application or plugin configuration

### 5. Routing

The `Zaphyr\Router\Router` class is responsible for routing the request to the appropriate controller:

- It prepares route groups and routes
- It sets the middleware stack on the dispatcher
- It delegates the actual handling to the dispatcher

### 6. Dispatching

The `Zaphyr\Router\Dispatcher` class is responsible for dispatching the request to the appropriate handler:

- It gets the route data from the route collector
- It dispatches the request based on the HTTP method and path
- It handles different dispatch results (not found, method not allowed, found)
- If a route is found, it adds the route to the request attributes
- It sets up the middleware stack
- It processes the request through the middleware stack

### 7. Middleware processing

The request passes through several middleware:

#### 7.1 CookieMiddleware

- Processes the request
- Adds any queued cookies to the response

#### 7.2 SessionMiddleware

- Starts a session
- Adds it to the request attributes
- Processes the request
- Saves the session

#### 7.3 CSRFMiddleware

- Checks if the request is a read method, is running in test mode, is excluded from CSRF protection, or has a valid CSRF
  token
- If any of these conditions are met, it processes the request
- Adds a CSRF cookie to the response

#### 7.4 XSSMiddleware

- Cleans the query parameters and parsed body of the request
- If it detects XSS, it throws an exception
- Otherwise, it processes the request

### 8. Controller execution

After passing through the middleware stack, the request reaches the controller:

- The controller processes the request
- It returns a response

### 9. Response emission

The response is then emitted back to the client:

- The `Zaphyr\Framework\Kernel\HttpKernel` returns the response to the `Zaphyr\Framework\Application`
- The `Zaphyr\Framework\Application` uses the `Zaphyr\HttpEmitter\Contracts\EmitterInterface` to emit the response
- The response is sent back to the client

## Event System

The ZAPHYR framework uses an event system to allow for hooking into the request lifecycle:

### RequestStartingEvent

- `Zaphyr\Framework\Events\Http\RequestStartingEvent` is dispatched at the beginning of the request handling process
- Contains the request object

### RequestFailedEvent

- `Zaphyr\Framework\Events\Http\RequestFailedEvent` is dispatched when an exception occurs during the request handling
  process
- Contains the request and the exception object

### RequestFinishedEvent

- `Zaphyr\Framework\Events\Http\RequestFinishedEvent` is dispatched at the end of the request handling process
- Contains the request and the response object
